# Generative-Adversarial-Spatial-Transformer-Network

This repository consturct a Generative Adversarial Network using [Spatial Transformer Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02025.pdf). 

## Spatial Transformer Network
Spatial transformer network, proposed by Max Jaderberg, Karen Simonyan, Andrew Zisserman and Koray Kavukcuoglu, is used to solve the spatial invariant problem of CNN model. is composed of 3 elements:
* Localization network
